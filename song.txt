Won't you stay 'til the a.m.?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the a.m., yeah-yeah

Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks forget about time
There could be World War 3 going on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time?
